# Exploratory Data Analysis On The Top 2000 Companies

This project focuses on conducting an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset obtained from the Kaggle website. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about the top 2000 global companies. EDA is a crucial step in understanding the main characteristics of a dataset and gaining valuable insights through visual methods. The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, including distribution, top companies, geographical representation, and correlations between key numerical variables.

(EDA) provides insights into the dataset's main characteristics, often using visual methods.

EDA Plan:

Distribution Analysis:
Visualize the distribution of key numerical columns such as Sales, Profits, Assets, and Market Value.

Top Companies Analysis:
Identify the top 10 companies by Sales, Profits, and Market Value.

Geographical Analysis:
Visualize the distribution of companies by Continent and Country.

Correlation Analysis:
Investigate the relationship between Sales, Profits, Assets, and Market Value to see if any of them are strongly correlated.
